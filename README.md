# Modified ESRGAN for solving the Super Resolution Problem
 
We present a PyTorch Lightning implementation of the [ESRGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00219.pdf) with the supplementary usage of the wasserstein loss. In addition, we have introduced two modified models of the ESRGAN: 

ESRGAN+IR: 

DRGAN: 

The full explaination of these models, the dataset used for the training and the validation phases and the results obtained on the Set5 are shown in this [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18OlSyFmXV3yE6B_baPHN-psWyn_5bPD3?usp=sharing). The preview of the notebook is available [here](https://github.com/IacobelliEmanuele/Modified-ESRGAN-for-Super-Resolution-Problem/blob/main/Modified_ESRGAN_for_solving_Super_Resolution_problem.ipynb).

## Weights:
